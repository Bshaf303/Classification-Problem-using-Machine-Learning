Classification Problem using Machine Learning

This is a forest cover classification problem. The original data is located at: 
UCI Cover Type Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype
UCI dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/

In summary there are 581011 observations across 54 columns. The dependent variable is the "cover type" 
which are the trees found within the region. 

The data is derived from the remote sensing and GIS program at the department of forest services in conjuction 
with Colorado State University. The GIS panels come in 30 X 30 meter cells and each cell has attributes that 
are found in the data set. In addition to the GIS data there is also data from the US Geological Survey (USGS)
that is used to give attributes to the soil type found within the cells. The Soil Type is 40 binary columns alone. 

This project is done in RStudio starting with the exploratory analysis of the data and then we get into finding
the statistical significance of the variable relationships and finishing with various classification modeling
techniques to see if we can accurately predict the forest cover type on a test sample of the data. 

Git was not setup at the time of this project and I manually uploaded code file attached as an RNotebook.
